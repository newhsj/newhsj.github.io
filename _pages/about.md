Hardly Strictly Jerry was born in 2016 on a lanai in Kailua, Hawaii, where a musical ohana formed to play the music that Jerry Garcia wrote, and the music that he covered, and sometimes the music we think Jerry would have liked had he been around to hear it.

Over the years, many musicians have been a part of the HSJ ohana, including: 
Thomas Cummings,
Dan Curran, 
Kevin Holder, 
Steve Howells,
Philip Johnson,
Justin Murata, 
Jeremy Pearl,
Paul Perrone,
Kevin Richards,
Michael Shapiro,
Forrest Simpson,
Matt Vazzano,
and Chris Zorn.
